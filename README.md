<br>
**Project Title:**<br>
Electronic Device Detection using AI/ML<br>
**Objective:<br>**
To develop a system capable of identifying and categorizing electronic devices from images or video feeds.<br>
**Methodology:**<br>
Collected and preprocessed a dataset of images featuring various electronic devices.<br>
Utilized machine learning algorithms, potentially including deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for feature extraction and classification.<br>
Trained the model to accurately detect and classify devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, etc.<br>
**Outcome:**<br>
Developed a functional model with a certain level of accuracy in detecting electronic devices.<br>
Potentially created a user interface or application for demonstrating the model's capabilities.<br>
**Skills Applied:**<br>
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing, Data Preprocessing, Model Training and Evaluation, Python programming, and possibly specific frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.<br>
