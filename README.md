# Electronic-Device-Detection
<br>
**Project Title:**<br>
Electronic Device Detection using AI/ML
**Objective:<br>**
To develop a system capable of identifying and categorizing electronic devices from images or video feeds.
**Methodology:**<br>
Collected and preprocessed a dataset of images featuring various electronic devices.
Utilized machine learning algorithms, potentially including deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for feature extraction and classification.
Trained the model to accurately detect and classify devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, etc.
**Outcome:**<br>
Developed a functional model with a certain level of accuracy in detecting electronic devices.
Potentially created a user interface or application for demonstrating the model's capabilities.
**Skills Applied:**<br>
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing, Data Preprocessing, Model Training and Evaluation, Python programming, and possibly specific frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
